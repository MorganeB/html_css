		Humor</h2><br>
		<h4>"He can run as fast as Severus Snape confronted with shampoo."  Fred Weasley <br><br>
		
		"Longbottom, if brains were gold you'd be poorer than Weasley, and that's saying something." Draco Malfoy<br><br>
		
		"Hermione interrupted them: "Aren't you two ever going to read Hogwarts : A History ?" <br>
		"What's the point?" said Ron. "You know it off by heart, we can just ask you." Ron and Hermione <br><br>
		
		'You know, Minister, I disagree with Dumbledore on many counts... but you cannot deny he's got style...'  Phineas Nigellus <br><br>	
		</h4>

		<h2>Power</h2><br>
		<h4>"It is our choices that show what we truly are, far more than our abilities." Dumbledore <br><br>
		"There is no good and evil, there is only power, and those too weak to seek it" Quirrell / Lord Voldemort<br><br>
		"You know, the Stone was really not such a wonderful thing. As much money and life as you could want! 
		The two things most human beings would choose above all - the trouble is, humans do have a knack of choosing precisely those things that are worst for them." Dumbledore <br><br>
		</h4>
		<h2>Love / Friendship</h2><br>
		<h4>"Your mother died to save you. If there is one thing Voldemort cannot understand, it is love. He didn't realise that love as powerful as mother's for you leaves its own mark. 
		Not a scar, no visible sign.... to have been loved so deeply, even though the person who loved us is gone, will give us some protection for ever." Dumbledore <br><br>
		
		"He must've known I'd run out on you.<br>
		"No, Harry corrected him. He must have known you'd always want to come back." Ron and Harry <br><br>
		
		"Do not pity the dead, Harry. Pity the living, and above all, those who live without love." Dumbledore <br><br>
		
		"But you know happiness can be found even in the darkest of times, when one only remembers to turn on the light." Dumbledore <br><br>
